2. Snippet of your code (usually a cpp file including `main`.)
3. The benchmark circuit for which the error occurs. (Preferably smaller circuits, if it is possible to minimize it first.)
4. What went wrong? (e.g. the optimized circuit was not equivalent to the original one, an assertion failed, etc.)

**Environment**
 - OS: [e.g. Linux]
 - Compiler: [e.g. GCC 12]
